In this talk, we focus on the efficient and certified numerical approximation of *parametric Hermitian eigenproblems*, with particular attention to computing the smallest eigenvalue and its associated eigenspace. Such parametric eigenvalue problems play a central role in diverse applications, including parametric PDEs and quantum spin systems (QSS), and are typically computationally demanding and inherently multi-query, requiring repeated evaluations across a parameter range. <br> Our approach is based on *projection-based MOR*, in which the original high-dimensional problem is projected onto a carefully constructed low-dimensional subspace. This subspace is built using *weak-greedy algorithms* applied over continuous or discrete parameter sets. A crucial ingredient in any greedy strategy is the availability of reliable and efficiently computable error estimates. We derive a novel a posteriori error estimator tailored to the approximation of the eigenspace associated with the smallest eigenvalues. The key insight is that accurate approximation of the *spectral gap* - the separation between the smallest and second-smallest eigenvalues — combined with exact recovery of the *eigenspace dimension* in the projected problem, enables rigorous certification of the eigenspace approximation error. <br> We conclude with numerical experiments demonstrating the performance of the proposed methodology on QSS models, including the XXZ and BBQ chain models. | December 18, 2025 <br><br> 4:00 PM <br><br> [Main Lecture Hall, Aurora building (ex-ISEF)](https://num-gssi.github.io/venues/)|
<img style="width:60px;" src="https://math.aalto.fi/pics/people/ap-2023/file_crop1_1207427_y_384.jpg">|[Vanni Noferini](https://math.aalto.fi/~noferiv1/)<br> Aalto University, Finland | **Rank-2 nonnegative matrix factorizations and their variants** <br><br> The nonnegative rank of a nonnegative matrix N ≥ 0 is the smallest integer r such that a nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) N=LR^T exists, where L, R are both nonnegative and have r columns. Denoting the usual linear-algebraic rank by rank(N), clearly r ≥ rank(N); the inequality may be strict when rank(N) ≥ 3. A related task is computing a rank- nonnegative matrix approximation (NMA) of N, i.e., a rank-r nonnegative matrix N_r=LR^T  that minimizes the distance from N. Computing a rank-r NMA is NP-hard if r≥3, and solvable in O(mn)  flops if r=1; as far as I know, it is an open question to determine whether the problem is NP-hard or not if r=2. <br> The borderline case of computing rank-2 NMAs is particularly interesting: it is more accessible to mathematical analysis because the two notions of rank coincide, and it can be solved efficiently in some special cases, but it remains computationally challenging for a general input. Furthermore, it arises in many applications, including medical imaging, network analysis, and signal processing. Currently, some of the best general-purpose algorithms are based on Alternating Nonnegative Least Squares (ANLS), though this method can be sensitive to initialization and may converge to suboptimal solutions. <br> In my talk, I will present a full parametrization of all possible NMFs of a rank-2 nonnegative matrix N. To my knowledge, this result was previously only available in the special case where  N is completely positive. <br> Based on this parametrization, I propose a simple algorithm to compute a possibly suboptimal rank-2 NMA to an arbitrary input N ≥ 0. Being very inexpensive, this method can serve as an effective initialization strategy for ANLS. Extensive numerical experiments illustrate that this approach can improve both the efficiency and the accuracy of NMA computations via ANLS. For small input size, I will also compare with the guaranteed exact NMA computed by an O(2^(mn)) algorithm based on algebraic geometry; the outcome of this experiment suggests that even the probability that the output of ANLS is the correct answer (up to noise due to floating point computation) is improved by using our newly proposed starting point. <br> The talk is based on joint research with Etna Lindy and Paul Van Dooren. | December 17, 2025 <br><br> 4:00 PM <br><br> [Main Lecture Hall, Aurora building (ex-ISEF)](https://num-gssi.github.io/venues/)|

(2021) and Tagliaferro (2022) proposed some iterative methods for the numerical solution of linear systems which, under the classical hypothesis of strict diagonal dominance, typically converge faster than the Jacobi method, but slower than the forward/backward Gauss-Seidel one. In these lectures we introduce a general class of iterative methods, based on suitable splittings of the matrix that defines the system, which include all of the methods mentioned above and have the same cost per iteration in a sequential computation environment. We also introduce a partial order relation in the set of the splittings and show that such partial order is typically connected to the speed of convergence of the corresponding methods. We pay particular attention to the case of linear systems for which the Jacobi iteration matrix is nonnegative, in which case we give a rigorous proof of the correspondence between the partial order relation and the magnitude of the spectral radius of the iteration matrices. Within the considered general class, some new specific promising methods are proposed as well.

Several randomised and deterministic algorithms are now available for the CSSP.

However, when stability results by first approximation does not apply, things become more involved, and general purpose codes may fail. This is the case, e.g., of Hamiltonian problems, for which the class of Runge-Kutta methods, known as Hamiltonian Boundary Value Methods (HBVMs), has been recently proposed. Such methods, in turn, are equivalent to a truncated expansion of the vector field along the Legendre orthonormal polynomial basis. This fact, coupled with the availability of a very efficient nonlinear iteration for their implementation, allows the use of HBVMs as spectrally accurate methods in time. The truncated expansion can be also regarded as imposing the orthogonality of the residual, w.r.t. a suitable inner product, to all polynomials of a certain degree. This allows, in turn, the use of different polynomial bases, as well as the extension of the approach for coping with different differential problems. As an example, the extension to the case of fractional differential equations has been recently studied. | February 17, 2025 <br><br> 5:30 PM <br><br> [Main Lecture Hall, Aurora building (ex-ISEF)](https://num-gssi.github.io/venues/)|

Interpreting the weights as a probability distribution, we choose them by maximizing the “amount of uncertainty” or entropy, subject to the constraint that the mean squared error is prescribed to a desired (small) value. By acting on this error, we get a robust method for linear and nonlinear regression that automatically detects and removes outliers from the dataset during the fitting procedure, by assigning them a very small weight. We consider the use of both polynomials and univariate/bivariate splines. To show the potential of the maximal-entropy approach in least squares approximation of data we consider a number of illustrations in different application fields. | February 17, 2025 <br><br> 4:15 PM <br><br> [Main Lecture Hall, Aurora building (ex-ISEF)](https://num-gssi.github.io/venues/)|

However, such a reduced-order model may be a bad approximation to the full-order system, if the initial condition is not zero. In the literature there are several attempts for modified reduction methods at the price of having no error bound or only a posteriori error bounds which are often too expensive to evaluate. In this talk we propose a new balancing procedure that is based on a shift transformation on the state. We first derive a joint projection reduced-order model in which the part of the system depending only on the input and the one depending only on the initial value are reduced at once and we prove an a priori error bound. With this result at hand, we derive a separate projection procedure in which the two parts are reduced separately. This gives the freedom to choose different reduction orders for the different subsystems. Moreover, we discuss how the reduced-order models can be constructed in practice. Since the error bounds are parameter-dependent, we show how they can be optimized efficiently. We conclude by comparing our results with the ones from the literature by a series of numerical experiments.

The gCQ is a generalization of Lubich's Convolution Quadrature (CQ) that allows for variable steps. The available stability and convergence theory for the gCQ requires non realistic regularity assumptions on the data, which do not hold in many applications of interest, such as the approximation of subdiffusion equations. It is well known that for non smooth enough data the original CQ, with uniform steps, presents an order reduction close to the singularity. We generalize the analysis of the gCQ to data satisfying realistic regularity assumptions and provide sufficient conditions for stability and convergence on arbitrary sequences of time points. We consider the particular case of graded meshes and show how to choose them optimally, according to the behaviour of the data. An important advantage of the gCQ method is that it allows for a fast and memory reduced implementation. We describe how the fast and oblivious gCQ can be implemented and illustrate our theoretical results with several numerical experiments. <br><br> [Recording of the talk (available to GSSI only)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FH5seMIlSFSbMlOsJ_21z54eKqDz3IOi/view?usp=sharing) | January 29, 2025 <br><br> 5:00 PM <br><br> [Main Lecture Hall, Aurora building (ex-ISEF)](https://num-gssi.github.io/venues/)|

First, we consider the problem for polynomial matrices when the size, degree, rank, invariant factors, infinite elementary divisors, and the minimal indices of their left and right null spaces are prescribed and prove that a polynomial matrix with these data exists if and only if these data satisfy a surprisingly simple unique condition related to a fundamental constraint known as the "index sum theorem'". In the second place, we extend this result to rational matrices when the size, rank, invariant rational functions, invariant orders at infinity, and minimal indices of their left and right null spaces are prescribed. The data prescribed so far are called in the literature the "complete structural data" or the "complete eigenstructure" of the polynomial or rational matrix. Finally, in addition to the complete eigenstructure, we also prescribe the minimal indices of the row and column spaces and show that the simple condition found in the previous problems must be completed with a majorization relation among the involved indices, the degrees of the invariant factors and of the infinite elementary divisors. | January 23, 2024 <br><br> 2:30 PM <br><br> [Main Lecture Hall, Aurora building (ex-ISEF)](https://num-gssi.github.io/venues/)|

The surface must contain a given disc orthogonal to the vector of velocity and have a given altitude. The solution of Newton became a classical example in the calculus of variations. However, in early 1990s G.Butazzo, D.Kawohl, and P.Guasoni presented a surface of a smaller resistance. They showed that the optimality of Newtons's surface concerns only a special case (although, considered to be general by most of specialists). The aerodynamic problem had to be solved again under general assumptions, which turned out to be a hard task. The solution is still unknown, although some properties of the optimal surface have been established. We give a survey of some of the known results including construction of non-convex surfaces of arbitrary small resistance and of invisible surfaces. Then we present a new approach to analyze the optimal convex surface by using inequalities between derivatives. Some of these inequalities are, probably, of independent interest.

The motivation comes from approximations in quantum dynamics by multiple Gaussians and approximations of various dynamical problems by tensor networks and neural networks. In all these cases, the parametrization is typically irregular: the derivative $\Phi'(q)$ can have arbitrarily small singular values and may have varying rank. We derive approximation results for a regularized approach in the time-continuous case as well as in time-discretized cases. With a suitable choice of the regularization parameter and the time stepsize, the approach can be successfully applied in irregular situations, even though it runs counter to the basic principle in numerical analysis to avoid solving ill-posed subproblems when aiming for a stable algorithm. Numerical experiments with sums of Gaussians for approximating quantum dynamics and with neural networks for approximating the flow map of a system of ordinary differential equations illustrate and complement the theoretical results.

We start from a possible “economic game” which simulates the relationship between companies and customers, involving company sales, costs and value-assets. So we establish an equilibrium which can be seen as a weighted average of a random variable. Then we arrive at a basic iterable algebraic equation that establishes a relationship between sales and its estimated forecast. The analysis of the evolution of the simple deviations between sales and estimate forecasts is also proposed. Afterwards we keep into account the actual results related to a manufacturing company (with 130 clerks and workers), limiting our analysis to the evolution during 40 months (time unit is the month) of a single product relating to a single customer.

Of late, researchers have devoted their effort in devising parallel-in-time methods for the numerical solution of time-dependent PDEs, adding a new dimension of parallelism and allowing to speed-up the solution process on modern supercomputers. In this talk, we present a parallel-in-time preconditioner for the all-at-once linear system arising when employing a Runge--Kutta method in time. The resulting system is solved iteratively for the numerical solution and for the stages of the method. The proposed preconditioner results in a block-diagonal solution for the stages, and a Schur complement obtained by solving again systems for the stages. A range of numerical experiments validate the robustness of the preconditioner with respect to the discretization parameters and to the number of stages, showing the speed-up achieved on a parallel architecture.

I will present examples of attack algorithms in image classification and optical character recognition. I will also outline recent results on the overarching question of whether, under reasonable assumptions, it is inevitable that AI tools will be vulnerable to attack.| May 8, 2024 <br><br> 5:30 PM <br><br> [Auditorium, Polaris building (Rectorate)](https://num-gssi.github.io/venues/)|

The problem is motivated especially by the stability considerations for the associated linear control system. The major difficulty in the minimization of the spectral abscissa is that its dependence on the parameters is non-Lipschitz. A remedy to this is, for a prescribed epsilon > 0, minimizing the epsilon-pseudospectral abscissa, the real part of the rightmost point in the set consisting of eigenvalues of all matrices at a distance of epsilon with respect to the spectral norm. We present a subspace framework to minimize the epsilon-pseudospectral abscissa of a large matrix dependent on parameters analytically. At every subspace iteration, a one-sided subspace restriction on the parameter-dependent matrix yields a small rectangular pseudospectral abscissa minimization problem. We expand the restriction subspace based on the minimizer of this small problem. We prove in theory for the proposed subspace framework that, assuming the global minimizers of the small problems are retrieved, convergence to the global minimizer of the original large-scale pseudospectral abscissa minimization problem occurs in the infinite dimensional setting. Our theoretical findings are illustrated on real large-scale examples that concern the stabilization by static output feedback of benchmark linear control systems.| April 23, 2024 <br><br> 4:45 PM <br><br> [Main Lecture Hall, Aurora building (ex-ISEF)](https://num-gssi.github.io/venues/)|

In this talk, I will present recent developments in this area by illustrating two case studies. <br> First, motivated by applications in cognitive science, I will present 'rating impossibility' theorems. They identify frameworks where deep learning is provably unable to generalize outside the training set for the seemingly simple task of learning identity effects, i.e. classifying whether pairs of objects are identical or not. <br> Second, motivated by applications in scientific computing, I will illustrate 'practical existence' theorems. They combine universal approximation results for deep neural networks with compressed sensing and high-dimensional polynomial approximation theory. As a result, they yield sufficient conditions on the network architecture, the training strategy, and the number of samples able to guarantee accurate approximation of smooth functions of many variables. <br> Time permitting, I will also discuss work in progress and open questions. | June 1, 2023 <br><br> 2:00 PM <br><br> [Auditorium, Polaris building (Rectorate)](https://num-gssi.github.io/venues/)|

These problems arise from semi-discretized semi-linear parabolic partial differential equations on continuous domains or on inherently discrete graph domains. A series of results reduces the requirement of computing linear combinations of $\varphi$-functions in exponential integrators to the approximation of the action of a smaller number of matrix exponentials on certain vectors. State-of-the-art computational methods use polynomial Krylov subspaces of adaptive size for this task. They have the drawback that the required Krylov subspace iteration numbers to obtain a desired tolerance increase drastically with the spectral radius of the discrete linear differential operator, e.g., the problem size. We present an approach that leverages rational Krylov subspace methods promising superior approximation qualities. We prove a novel a-posteriori error estimate of rational Krylov approximations to the action of the matrix exponential on vectors for single time points, which allows for an adaptive approach similar to existing polynomial Krylov techniques. We discuss pole selection and the efficient solution of the arising sequences of shifted linear systems by direct and preconditioned iterative solvers. Numerical experiments show that our method outperforms the state of the art for sufficiently large spectral radii of the discrete linear differential operators. The key to this are approximately constant rational Krylov iteration numbers, which enable a near-linear scaling of the runtime with respect to the problem size. | April 18, 2023 <br><br> 5:30 PM <br><br> [Main Lecture Hall, Aurora building (ex-ISEF)](https://num-gssi.github.io/venues/)|

First, the dynamical low-rank approximation together with the projector-splitting numerical integrator is summarised. Then, recent developments on the field are presented. The so-called fixed-rank unconventional BUG integrator is introduced and analysed. Next, a simple but extremely effective modification allowing for an adaptive choice of the rank, using subspaces generated by the integrator itself, is illustrated. It is shown that the novel BUG adaptive low-rank integrator retains the exactness, robustness and symmetry-preserving properties of the previously proposed fixed-rank integrators. Beyond that, up to the truncation tolerance, the rank-adaptive integrator preserves the norm when the differential equation does, it preserves the energy for Schroedinger equations and Hamiltonian systems, and it preserves the monotonic decrease in gradient flows.

Such matrix equations have been considered, for example, in the context of parallel-in-time integration leading to a class of algorithms called ParaDiag. We develop and analyze two novel approaches for the numerical solution of such equations. Our first approach is based on the observation that the modification of these equations performed by ParaDiag in order to solve them in parallel has low rank. Building upon previous work on low-rank updates of matrix equations, this allows us to make use of tensorized Krylov subspace methods to account for the modification. Our second approach is based on interpolating the solution of the matrix equation from the solutions of several modifications. Both approaches avoid the use of iterative refinement needed by ParaDiag and related space-time approaches in order to attain good accuracy. In turn, our new approaches have the potential to outperform, sometimes significantly, existing approaches.

For IEEE-compliant formats, rounding requires only standard mathematical library functions, but handling subnormals, underflow, and overflow demands special attention, and numerical errors can cause mathematically correct formulae to behave incorrectly in finite arithmetic. Moreover, the ensuing algorithms are not necessarily efficient, as the library functions these techniques build upon are typically designed to handle a broad range of cases and may not be optimized for the specific needs of floating-point rounding algorithms. CPFloat is a C library that offers efficient routines for rounding arrays of binary32 and binary64 numbers to lower precision. The software exploits the bit level representation of the underlying formats and performs only low-level bit manipulation and integer arithmetic, without relying on costly library calls. In numerical experiments the new techniques bring a considerable speedup (typically one order of magnitude or more) over existing alternatives in C, C++, and MATLAB.

It has been known for half a century that the dynamics of incompressible ideal fluids in two dimensions can be understood as an evolution equation on the contangent bundle of the infinite-dimensional Lie group of symplectic dffeomorphisms. In particular, the vorticity equation constitutes a Lie-Poisson system characterized by an infinite number of first integrals, i.e. the integrated powers of vorticity. This set of constraints, absent in three dimensions, has profound effects on the energy transfer mechanisms across scales of motion. Yet, the construction of a numerical system which preserves this rich Poisson structure has been elusive. Most attempts either fail in fully preserving the geometric structure or have a high computational complexity. Here, I will show that, thanks to our recent advances, it possible to design a geometric integrator which embeds this fundamental principle of the continuum into the discrete system at a modest computational cost.

Such controls, which are mainly passive, are designed for stabilising linearly unstable configurations. The design strategy based on global stability analysis can be rigorously applied to relatively simple flows in laminar regime. More complex configurations can also be rigorously treated, as for instance cases in which the flow to be controlled is time periodic. Moreover, a large interest exists in the application of the same methods for the control of coherent large-scale flow structures in turbulent flows as, for instance, the quasi-periodic shedding of vortices in turbulent wakes.

The simplest non-trivial example is the problem of stabilisation (or, conversely, destabilisation) of two pendulums by the same common control. An exact description of reachable sets is most often impossible here, but their asymptotic behaviour as T→∞ can be found with high accuracy. In the talk, I will present the asymptotic behaviour of reachable sets in the problem of controlling a system of N independent oscillators, and in the problem of controlling the wave equation for a closed string.

One of the problems is that often the positive effects of meditation that have been reported are anecdotal or are based on self reporting. To quantify the effects of meditation, it is therefore important to develop methods based on medical imaging to identify brain regions that are involved in the meditation practice. In this talk, we review some recent results about this topic, addressed by using magnetoencephalography (MEG) to map brain activity during meditation. One of the difficulties here is that the data are less sensitive to activity taking place in the deep brain regions, including the limbic system that is believed to play an important role in meditation. The MEG inverse problem is addressed by using novel Bayesian methods combined with advanced numerical techniques, applied on data from professional Buddhist meditators.

Given a generator $A$, a time $t > 0$, an arbitrary initial vector $u_0$ and an error tolerance $\epsilon > 0$, the algorithm computes $\exp(tA)u_0$ with error bounded by $\epsilon$. The (parallelisable) algorithm is based on a combination of a regularized functional calculus, suitable contour quadrature rules and the adaptive computation of resolvents in infinite dimensions. As a particular case, we deal with semigroups on $L^2(R^d)$ that are generated by partial differential operators with polynomially bounded coefficients of locally bounded total variation. For analytic semigroups, we provide a quadrature rule whose error decreases like $\exp(−cN/ log(N))$ for $N$ quadrature points, that remains stable as $N \to \infty$, and which is also suitable for infinite-dimensional operators. Finally, we extend the method to time-fractional PDEs (where it avoids singularities as $t \to  0$ and large memory consumption). Numerical examples are given, including: Schrödinger and wave equations on the aperiodic Ammann–Beenker tiling and fractional beam equations arising in the modelling of small-amplitude vibration of viscoelastic materials.

Amid many different approaches, two common paradigms have emerged. On the one hand, primarily data-driven approaches—such as deep neural networks—have proven extremely successful in recent years. Their success is based mainly on their ability to approximate complicated functions with generic models when trained using vast amounts of data and enormous computational resources. But despite many recent triumphs, deep neural networks are difficult to analyze and thus remain mysterious. Most importantly, they lack the robustness, explainability, interpretability, efficiency, and fairness needed for high-stakes decision-making. On the other hand, increasingly realistic model-based approaches—typically derived from first principles and formulated as partial differential equations (PDEs)—are now available for various tasks. One can often calibrate these models—which enable detailed theoretical studies, analysis, and interpretation—with relatively few measurements, thus facilitating their accurate predictions of phenomena. In this talk, I will highlight recent advances and ongoing work to understand and improve deep learning by using techniques from partial differential equations. I will demonstrate how PDE techniques can yield better insight into deep learning algorithms, more robust networks, and more efficient numerical algorithms. I will also expose some of the remaining computational and numerical challenges in this area. <br><br> [Slides of the talk](https://indico.gssi.it/event/248/attachments/311/509/2021-LRGSSI.pdf) <br>[Recording of the talk (available to GSSI only)](https://indico.gssi.it/event/248/attachments/311/510/go) | June 17, 2021 <br><br> 4:00 PM|

These data-driven representations led in turn to new system identification, signal processing, and control methods. In particular, data-driven simulation and linear quadratic tracking control problems were solved using the new approach [1,2]. This talk shows how the approach can be used further on for solving data-driven interpolation and approximation problems (missing data estimation) and how it can be generalized to some classes of nonlinear systems. The theory leads to algorithms that are both general (can deal simultaneously with missing, exact, and noisy data of multivariable systems) and simple (require existing numerical linear algebra methods only).

This can be done by several well-known regularization techniques. Many practical problems are successfully solved on this way. What does not still look as completely satisfactory is that the new reset problem seems to appear rather implicitly in the very process of its solution. <br> In 1980, A. N. Tikhonov proposed a reformulation [1] that arises explicitly before the discussion of the solution methods. He suggested a notion of normal solution to a family of  linear algebraic systems described by a given individual system and its vicinity comprising perturbed systems, under the assumption that there are compatible systems in the class notwithstanding the compatibility property of the given individual system. Tikhovov proved that the normal solution exists and is unique. However, a natural question about the correctness of the reset problem was not answered. In this talk we address a question of correctness of the reformulated incorrect problems that seems to have been missed in all previous considerations. The main result is the proof of correctness for Tikhonov's normal solution. Possible generalizations and difficulties will be also discussed. <br><br> [1] A. N.

Based on these observations we want to infer the (dynamical) interactions between the entities we observe. In the context of a distributed system, this typically corresponds to a "network identification" task: find the (weighted) edges of the graph of interconnections. However, often the number of samples we can obtain from such a process are far too few to identify the edges of the network exactly. Can we still reliably infer some aspects of the underlying system? <br> Motivated by this question we consider the following identification problem: instead of trying to infer the exact network, we aim to recover a (low-dimensional) statistical model of the network based on the observed signals on the nodes.  More concretely, here we focus on observations that consist of snapshots of a diffusive process that evolves over the unknown network. We model the (unobserved) network as generated from an independent draw from a latent stochastic blockmodel (SBM), and our goal is to infer both the partition of the nodes into blocks, as well as the parameters of this SBM. We present simple spectral algorithms that provably solve the partition and parameter inference problems with high-accuracy. <br> We further discuss some possible variations and extensions of this problem setup. <br><br> [Recording of the talk (available to GSSI only)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OA-4ZXxRBWAbPjbTF-c-TdTfnUAl6Q77/view?usp=sharing) | February 17, 2021 <br><br> 6:00 PM|

However, DL has an Achilles heel: it is universaly unstable so that small changes in the initial data can lead to large errors in the final result. This has been documented in a wide variety of applications. Paradoxically, the existence of stable neural networks for these applications is guaranteed by the celebrated Universal Approximation Theorem, however, the stable neural networks are never computed by the current training approaches. We will address this problem and the potential limitations of AI from a foundations point of view. Indeed, the current situation in AI is comparable to the situation in mathematics in the early 20th century, when David Hilbert’s optimism (typically reflected in his 10th problem) suggested no limitations to what mathematics could prove and no restrictions on what computers could compute. Hilbert’s optimism was turned upside down by Goedel and Turing, who established limitations on what mathematics can prove and which problems computers can solve (however, without limiting the impact of mathematics and computer science).    We predict a similar outcome for modern AI and DL, where the limitations of AI (the main topic of Smale’s 18th problem) will be established through the foundations of computational mathematics. We sketch the beginning of such a program by demonstrating how there exist neural networks approximating classical mappings in scientific computing, however, no algorithm (even randomised) can compute such a network to even 1-digit accuracy (with probability better than 1/2). We will also show how instability is inherit in the methodology of DL demonstrating that there is no easy remedy, given the current methodology. Finally, we will demonstrate basic examples in inverse problems where there exists (untrained) neural networks that can easily compute a solution to the problem, however, the current DL techniques will need 10^80 data points in the training set to get even 1% success rate. <br><br> [Recording of the talk](https://youtu.be/a-9BFjlCo3Q) | January 28, 2021 <br><br> 3:00 PM|

The use of CFD in this area poses several challenges. The clinical setting places heavy restrictions on both computational time and power. Simulation results are usually desired within minutes and are usually run on standard computers. For these reasons, steady-state Navier-Stokes simulations are usually preferred, as they can be completed in a fraction of the time required to run an unsteady computation. However, in many respects the steady problem is more difficult than the unsteady one, particularly in regards to solving the associated linear and nonlinear systems. Additionally, boundary data for patient-specific problems is often missing, incomplete, or unreliable. This makes the determination of a useful model challenging, as it requires the generation of reliable boundary data without introducing heavy computational costs. This seminar will address these challenges, as well as some others, and introduce new techniques for workarounds.

Frequency-domain electromagnetic instruments allow the collection of data in different configurations, that is, varying the intercoil spacing, the frequency, and the height above the ground.<br> Based on a non-linear forward model used to describe the interaction between an electromagnetic field and the soil, the aim is to reconstruct the distribution of either the electrical conductivity or the magnetic permeability with respect to depth. To this end, the inversion of both the real (in-phase) and the imaginary (quadrature) components of the signal are studied by a regularized damped Gauss-Newton method. The regularization part of the algorithm is based on a low-rank approximation of the Jacobian of the non-linear model. Furthermore, in many situations, a regularization scheme retrieving smooth solutions is blindly applied, without taking into account the prior available knowledge. An algorithm for a regularization method that promotes the sparsity of the reconstructed electrical conductivity or magnetic permeability distribution is available. This regularization strategy incorporates a minimum gradient support stabilizer into a truncated generalized singular value decomposition scheme. The whole inversion algorithm has been enclosed in a MATLAB package, called FDEMtools, allowing the user to experiment with synthetic and experimental data sets, and different regularization strategies, in order to compare them and draw conclusions.<br> The numerical effectiveness of the inversion procedure is demonstrated on synthetic and real datasets by using FDEMtools package. | November 20, 2020 <br><br> 5:15 PM|

The algorithm is a variant of Gauss-Jordan elimination that works on the low-rank factors $B$ and $C$ directly without ever forming those blocks. The individual elimination steps amount to a transformation called *principal pivot transform*; it was shown in [Poloni, Strabic 2016] how to perform it by working only on $A, B, C$, and we rely on that procedure here. We discuss the stability of the resulting method, and show how the algorithm (and in particular the produced low-rank factors) can be of use in control theory, in the context of the matrix sign iteration, which is a method used to solve algebraic Riccati equations.| September 30, 2020 <br><br> 4:00 PM|
