Nicola Gugliemi is full professor in Numerical Analysis and Chair of the Doctoral School in Mathematics at GSSI. He is interested in the general area of scientific computing, particularly numerical analysis of ordinary and delay differential equations, stability analysis of (discretized) dynamical systems - including variable coefficient and switched systems - and ode methods in matrix perturbation theory and control, for high-dimensional problems.  
More specifically: Stiff and singularly perturbed problems (in particular in the framework of delay differential equations); software development for general classes of implicit delay differential equations; stability analysis of numerical integrators for ordinary and delay differential equations; computation of the joint spectral characteristics of a set of matrices, with application to contractivity analysis of time dependent systems of differential and difference equations; ode-based pseudospectral computations for both unstructured and structured problems; non-smooth analysis of discontinuous differential equations with focus on the computation of weak solutions.

###  Francesco Tudisco

Hi! I am Associate Professor of Mathematics in the Numerical Analysis and Data Science group at the Gran Sasso Science Institute, an International School of Doctoral Studies and the ‘youngest’ among the Italian Schools of Excellence. My research interests lie at the intersection between matrix theory, numerical analysis, network science and machine learning. I am particularly interested in methods for nonlinear eigenvector problems, improving stability,  efficiency and trustworthyness of machine learning pipelines, the application of deep learning in scientific computing, and higher-order graph models in data mining. 
Before moving to the GSSI, I was a Marie Curie Individual Fellow at the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow (UK), working on the project: *[MAGNET: Models and algorithms for graph centrality based on nonlinear eigenvalue techniques](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/209527/reporting/en).* Prior to that, I held research assistant positions at Saarland University (Germany) and University of Padua (Italy). I obtained my PhD in Mathematics in 2015 from the University of Rome Tor Vergata (Italy).<br>

Arturo De Marinis is a PhD Student in Mathematics in Natural, Social and Life Sciences at GSSI.
He holds a degree in Mathematics from the University of Bari Aldo Moro. In his thesis, he proposed numerical methods for trajectory optimization of unmanned aerial vehicles based on optimal control theory. His current research interests lie between numerical analysis and machine learning, in particular he is now studying the stability of new machine learning models for supervised learning, the so called neural ordinary differential equations.
