The performance of numerical techniques for solving PDEs can be significantly affected by several undesirable effects. One of these subtle effects, referred to as numerical diffusion, may lead—if not carefully analyzed and controlled—to results that are inconsistent with the underlying physics of the system. | <br><img src="/img/post0.png" width="350"> |
