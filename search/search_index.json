Some specific topics of interest are: Numerical integration of nonsmooth dynamical systems The numerical treatment of differential equations usually relies on smoothness assumptions which play a fundamental role in the development of suitable schemes and in their convergence analysis. However, an emergent field of interest is systems of ODEs with discontinuous right hand side and many applications can be found in control theory (bang-bang controls), mechanical systems (dry friction) biology (gene regulatory networks), chemistry (gas liquid models). In most mathematical models described by discontinuous ODEs the vector field is piecewise smooth in subregions separated by manifolds and discontinuities take place across the manifolds. The existence and uniqueness of solutions are not anymore guaranteed at such interfaces and the classical Filippov theory becomes ambiguous when the discontinuity manifolds have co-dimension greater than 1. Infinitely many vector fields could be selected along the discontinuity manifolds and the corresponding solutions might have different qualitative behavior. This issue clearly affects also the numerical approximation of the solutions. Our aim is to investigate physical regularizations so to allow one to select a Filippov solution that has physical relevance. If we can show that the solutions of the regularized system converge uniformly to a particular Filippov solution, then we can select this solution for the discontinuous problem. The persistence of the qualitative behavior of solutions under regularization is fundamental if we wish to replace the discontinuous system with the regular one or viceversa, hence we will investigate this persistence as well. At the state of the art, numerical techniques for discontinuous problems, even though efficient, need to select a priori a sliding vector field in Filippov convex combination. Our studies would give rigorous theoretical justifications to make such selection in agreement with the original real life model that one wishes to simulate. Our research project focuses on getting new theoretical insight into numerical approaches and on exploiting this insight for the design and implementation of efficient algorithms. Computational analysis of complex networks Networks are a very powerful tool to model complex systems and analyze large data. For example, in exploratory data analysis we are often interested in finding clusters or communities, or assessing the importance (or centrality) of datapoints. As many real-world systems feature geographical, temporal, or categorical metadata and higher-order structures (motifs), models based on higher-order graphs such as hypergraphs, multilayer graphs and simplicial complexes are nowadays becoming prevalent. We are interested in developing both theoretical foundations and efficient algorithms for a range of network analysis problems.

They have since become important tools in image processing and over the last years semi-supervised learning strategies could be implemented with these PDEs at the core. The main ingredient is the graph Laplacian that stems from a graph representation of the data. This matrix is large and typically dense. We illustrate some of its crucial features and show how to efficiently work with the graph Laplacian. In particular, we need some of its eigenvectors and for this the Lanczos process needs to be implemented efficiently.

Zoom link Add event to Google calendar December 2, 2020 Patricia Diaz De Alba GSSI Numerical treatment for inverse electromagnetic problems Electromagnetic induction surveys are among the most popular techniques for non-destructive investigation of soil properties, in order to detect the presence of both ground inhomogeneities and particular substances. Frequency-domain electromagnetic instruments allow the collection of data in different configurations, that is, varying the intercoil spacing, the frequency, and the height above the ground. Based on a non-linear forward model used to describe the interaction between an electromagnetic field and the soil, the aim is to reconstruct the distribution of either the electrical conductivity or the magnetic permeability with respect to depth. To this end, the inversion of both the real (in-phase) and the imaginary (quadrature) components of the signal are studied by a regularized damped Gauss-Newton method. The regularization part of the algorithm is based on a low-rank approximation of the Jacobian of the non-linear model. Furthermore, in many situations, a regularization scheme retrieving smooth solutions is blindly applied, without taking into account the prior available knowledge. An algorithm for a regularization method that promotes the sparsity of the reconstructed electrical conductivity or magnetic permeability distribution is available. This regularization strategy incorporates a minimum gradient support stabilizer into a truncated generalized singular value decomposition scheme. The whole inversion algorithm has been enclosed in a MATLAB package, called FDEMtools, allowing the user to experiment with synthetic and experimental data sets, and different regularization strategies, in order to compare them and draw conclusions. The numerical effectiveness of the inversion procedure is demonstrated on synthetic and real datasets by using FDEMtools package. Zoom link Add event to Google calendar November 20, 2020 Christian Lubich University of Tuebingen Dynamical low-rank approximation This talk reviews differential equations and their numerical solution on manifolds of low-rank matrices or of tensors with a rank structure such as tensor trains or general tree tensor networks. These low-rank differential equations serve to approximate, in a data-compressed format, large time-dependent matrices and tensors or multivariate functions that are either given explicitly via their increments or are unknown solutions to high-dimensional evolutionary differential equations, with multi-particle time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equations and kinetic equations such as Vlasov equations as noteworthy examples of applications. Recently developed numerical time integrators are based on splitting the projection onto the tangent space of the low-rank manifold at the current approximation. In contrast to all standard integrators, these projector-splitting methods are robust to the unavoidable presence of small singular values in the low-rank approximation. This robustness relies on exploiting geometric properties of the manifold of low-rank matrices or tensors: in each substep of the projector-splitting algorithm, the approximation moves along a flat subspace of the low-rank manifold. In this way, high curvature due to small singular values does no harm. This talk is based on work done intermittently over the last decade with Othmar Koch, Bart Vandereycken, Ivan Oseledets, Emil Kieri, Hanna Walach and Gianluca Ceruti.

Sometimes such conservation properties naturally characterize the numerical schemes, while in more complex situations preservation issues have to be conveyed into the numerical approximations. The talk is focused on presenting recent advances in structure-preservation issues for selected stochastic differential equations satisfying some characteristic invariance laws. The behaviour of stochastic multistep methods in the preservation of mean-square contractivity will be analyzed; we show, in this case, that conservation properties are hidden, as a matter of fact, into conditional stability properties of numerical schemes. The analysis will also be conveyed to the discretization of stochastic Hamiltonian problems for the numerical preservation of the behaviour of the expected Hamiltonian. The theoretical analysis will also be supported by the numerical evidence.

In this talk, I will address the problem of controlling linear dynamical networks from a control-energy or \"practical\" perspective. I will first focus on the model-based scenario and review the fundamental metrics, theoretical limitations, and challenges in controlling networks using a limited number of control nodes. In particular, I will emphasize the impact of the \"degree\" of non-normality of the network's adjacency matrix on the control performance. Then, I will switch to a data-driven scenario, and show how some network control problems can be efficiently solved by relying on experimental data only. Slides of the seminar Zoom link Add event to Google calendar October 14, 2020 Federico Poloni University of Pisa Inverses of quasidefinite matrices in block-factored form, with an application to control theory (joint work with P. Benner) We describe an algorithm to compute the explicit inverse of a dense quasi-definite matrix, i.e., a symmetric matrix of the form [-BB^T, A; A^T, C^TC], with the (1,1) block negative semidefinite and the (2,2) block positive semidefinite. The algorithm is a variant of Gauss-Jordan elimination that works on the low-rank factors $B$ and $C$ directly without ever forming those blocks. The individual elimination steps amount to a transformation called principal pivot transform ; it was shown in [Poloni, Strabic 2016] how to perform it by working only on $A, B, C$, and we rely on that procedure here. We discuss the stability of the resulting method, and show how the algorithm (and in particular the produced low-rank factors) can be of use in control theory, in the context of the matrix sign iteration, which is a method used to solve algebraic Riccati equations.

Benner) We describe an algorithm to compute the explicit inverse of a dense quasi-definite matrix, i.e., a symmetric matrix of the form [-BB^T, A; A^T, C^TC], with the (1,1) block negative semidefinite and the (2,2) block positive semidefinite. The algorithm is a variant of Gauss-Jordan elimination that works on the low-rank factors $B$ and $C$ directly without ever forming those blocks. The individual elimination steps amount to a transformation called principal pivot transform ; it was shown in [Poloni, Strabic 2016] how to perform it by working only on $A, B, C$, and we rely on that procedure here. We discuss the stability of the resulting method, and show how the algorithm (and in particular the produced low-rank factors) can be of use in control theory, in the context of the matrix sign iteration, which is a method used to solve algebraic Riccati equations.
