Personal Web Page Alexander Viguerie My research lies at the intersection of numerical analysis and engineering, where I focus on the use of numerical simulations to answer questions arising from engineering applications. My work encompasses many aspects of these problems, including the development of new physical models and of new algorithms to enable their accurate and efficient numerical solution. In terms of applications, I have a specific interest in cardiological problems, where I have collaborated extensively with medical doctors and engineers to provide solutions to problems of clinical interest. I am also interested in the mathematical modeling of epidemics in space and time; the ultimate goal of this research is to aid public health decision-makers. My approach to this problem draws heavily on my experience in continuum mechanics, and I believe these principles can be applied further to solve problems arising from the life sciences. From the mathematical point of view, this work is heavily concentrated in the area of numerical partial differential equations and finite element methods. As much of this work naturally leads to numerical linear algebra, I am also interested in the development of preconditioning and inexact algebraic factorization methods for the numerical solution of partial differential equations.

Some specific topics of interest are: Numerical integration of nonsmooth dynamical systems The numerical treatment of differential equations usually relies on smoothness assumptions which play a fundamental role in the development of suitable schemes and in their convergence analysis. However, an emergent field of interest is systems of ODEs with discontinuous right hand side and many applications can be found in control theory (bang-bang controls), mechanical systems (dry friction) biology (gene regulatory networks), chemistry (gas liquid models). In most mathematical models described by discontinuous ODEs the vector field is piecewise smooth in subregions separated by manifolds and discontinuities take place across the manifolds. The existence and uniqueness of solutions are not anymore guaranteed at such interfaces and the classical Filippov theory becomes ambiguous when the discontinuity manifolds have co-dimension greater than 1. Infinitely many vector fields could be selected along the discontinuity manifolds and the corresponding solutions might have different qualitative behavior. This issue clearly affects also the numerical approximation of the solutions. Our aim is to investigate physical regularizations so to allow one to select a Filippov solution that has physical relevance. If we can show that the solutions of the regularized system converge uniformly to a particular Filippov solution, then we can select this solution for the discontinuous problem. The persistence of the qualitative behavior of solutions under regularization is fundamental if we wish to replace the discontinuous system with the regular one or viceversa, hence we will investigate this persistence as well. At the state of the art, numerical techniques for discontinuous problems, even though efficient, need to select a priori a sliding vector field in Filippov convex combination. Our studies would give rigorous theoretical justifications to make such selection in agreement with the original real life model that one wishes to simulate. Our research project focuses on getting new theoretical insight into numerical approaches and on exploiting this insight for the design and implementation of efficient algorithms. Computational analysis of complex networks Networks are a very powerful tool to model complex systems and analyze large data. For example, in exploratory data analysis we are often interested in finding clusters or communities, or assessing the importance (or centrality) of datapoints. As many real-world systems feature geographical, temporal, or categorical metadata and higher-order structures (motifs), models based on higher-order graphs such as hypergraphs, multilayer graphs and simplicial complexes are nowadays becoming prevalent.

Speaker Title, Abstract & Other Info Date Lars Ruthotto Emory University, USA Numerical Methods for Deep Learning motivated by Partial Differential Equations Understanding the world through data and computation has always formed the core of scientific discovery. Amid many different approaches, two common paradigms have emerged. On the one hand, primarily data-driven approaches\u2014such as deep neural networks\u2014have proven extremely successful in recent years. Their success is based mainly on their ability to approximate complicated functions with generic models when trained using vast amounts of data and enormous computational resources. But despite many recent triumphs, deep neural networks are difficult to analyze and thus remain mysterious. Most importantly, they lack the robustness, explainability, interpretability, efficiency, and fairness needed for high-stakes decision-making. On the other hand, increasingly realistic model-based approaches\u2014typically derived from first principles and formulated as partial differential equations (PDEs)\u2014are now available for various tasks. One can often calibrate these models\u2014which enable detailed theoretical studies, analysis, and interpretation\u2014with relatively few measurements, thus facilitating their accurate predictions of phenomena. In this talk, I will highlight recent advances and ongoing work to understand and improve deep learning by using techniques from partial differential equations. I will demonstrate how PDE techniques can yield better insight into deep learning algorithms, more robust networks, and more efficient numerical algorithms. I will also expose some of the remaining computational and numerical challenges in this area. Slides of the talk Recording of the talk (available to GSSI only) June 17, 2021 Ivan Markovsky Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium Data-driven dynamic interpolation and approximation The behavioral system theory give theoretical foundation for nonparameteric representations of linear time-invariant systems based on Hankel matrices constructed from data. These data-driven representations led in turn to new system identification, signal processing, and control methods. In particular, data-driven simulation and linear quadratic tracking control problems were solved using the new approach [1,2]. This talk shows how the approach can be used further on for solving data-driven interpolation and approximation problems (missing data estimation) and how it can be generalized to some classes of nonlinear systems. The theory leads to algorithms that are both general (can deal simultaneously with missing, exact, and noisy data of multivariable systems) and simple (require existing numerical linear algebra methods only). This opens a practical computational way of doing system theory and signal processing directly from data without identification of a transfer function or a state space representation and doing model-based design.

Tyrtyshnikov Institute for Numerical Mathematics, Russian Academy of Sciences Tikhonov's solution to a class of linear systems equivalent within perturbations A standard approach to incorrect problems suggests that a problem of interest is reformulated with the knowledge of some additional a-priori information. This can be done by several well-known regularization techniques. Many practical problems are successfully solved on this way. What does not still look as completely satisfactory is that the new reset problem seems to appear rather implicitly in the very process of its solution. In 1980, A. N. Tikhonov proposed a reformulation [1] that arises explicitly before the discussion of the solution methods. He suggested a notion of normal solution to a family of linear algebraic systems described by a given individual system and its vicinity comprising perturbed systems, under the assumption that there are compatible systems in the class notwithstanding the compatibility property of the given individual system. Tikhovov proved that the normal solution exists and is unique. However, a natural question about the correctness of the reset problem was not answered. In this talk we address a question of correctness of the reformulated incorrect problems that seems to have been missed in all previous considerations. The main result is the proof of correctness for Tikhonov's normal solution. Possible generalizations and difficulties will be also discussed. [1] A. N.

Based on these observations we want to infer the (dynamical) interactions between the entities we observe. In the context of a distributed system, this typically corresponds to a \"network identification\" task: find the (weighted) edges of the graph of interconnections. However, often the number of samples we can obtain from such a process are far too few to identify the edges of the network exactly. Can we still reliably infer some aspects of the underlying system? Motivated by this question we consider the following identification problem: instead of trying to infer the exact network, we aim to recover a (low-dimensional) statistical model of the network based on the observed signals on the nodes. More concretely, here we focus on observations that consist of snapshots of a diffusive process that evolves over the unknown network. We model the (unobserved) network as generated from an independent draw from a latent stochastic blockmodel (SBM), and our goal is to infer both the partition of the nodes into blocks, as well as the parameters of this SBM. We present simple spectral algorithms that provably solve the partition and parameter inference problems with high-accuracy. We further discuss some possible variations and extensions of this problem setup.

Zoom link Add event to Google calendar February 4, 2021 Anders Hansen University of Cambridge, UK On the foundations of computational mathematics, Smale's 18th problem and the potential limits of AI There is a profound optimism on the impact of deep learning (DL) and AI in the sciences with Geoffrey Hinton concluding that 'They should stop training radiologists now'. However, DL has an Achilles heel: it is universaly unstable so that small changes in the initial data can lead to large errors in the final result. This has been documented in a wide variety of applications. Paradoxically, the existence of stable neural networks for these applications is guaranteed by the celebrated Universal Approximation Theorem, however, the stable neural networks are never computed by the current training approaches. We will address this problem and the potential limitations of AI from a foundations point of view. Indeed, the current situation in AI is comparable to the situation in mathematics in the early 20th century, when David Hilbert\u2019s optimism (typically reflected in his 10th problem) suggested no limitations to what mathematics could prove and no restrictions on what computers could compute. Hilbert\u2019s optimism was turned upside down by Goedel and Turing, who established limitations on what mathematics can prove and which problems computers can solve (however, without limiting the impact of mathematics and computer science). We predict a similar outcome for modern AI and DL, where the limitations of AI (the main topic of Smale\u2019s 18th problem) will be established through the foundations of computational mathematics. We sketch the beginning of such a program by demonstrating how there exist neural networks approximating classical mappings in scientific computing, however, no algorithm (even randomised) can compute such a network to even 1-digit accuracy (with probability better than 1/2). We will also show how instability is inherit in the methodology of DL demonstrating that there is no easy remedy, given the current methodology. Finally, we will demonstrate basic examples in inverse problems where there exists (untrained) neural networks that can easily compute a solution to the problem, however, the current DL techniques will need 10^80 data points in the training set to get even 1% success rate.

In this setting, time dependent model order reductions techniques are desirable. In the present seminar, together with efficient numerical integrators, we present a recently developed approach: dynamical low-rank approximation. Dynamical low-rank approximation for matrices will be firstly presented, and a numerical integrator with two remarkable properties will be introduced: the matrix projector splitting integrator. Based upon this numerical integrator, we will construct two equivalent extensions for tensors, multi-dimensional arrays, in Tucker format - a high-order generalization of the SVD decomposition for matrices. These extensions are proven to preserve the excellent qualities of the matrix integrator. To conclude, via a novel compact formulation of the Tucker integrator, we will further extend the matrix and Tucker projector splitting integrators to the most general class of Tree Tensor Networks. Important examples belonging to this class and of interest for applications are given, but not only restricted to, by Tensor Trains. This seminar is based upon a joint work with Ch. Lubich and H. Walach.

Over the past several years, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations have become increasingly popular as a clinical tool for cardiologists at the patient-specific level. The use of CFD in this area poses several challenges. The clinical setting places heavy restrictions on both computational time and power. Simulation results are usually desired within minutes and are usually run on standard computers. For these reasons, steady-state Navier-Stokes simulations are usually preferred, as they can be completed in a fraction of the time required to run an unsteady computation. However, in many respects the steady problem is more difficult than the unsteady one, particularly in regards to solving the associated linear and nonlinear systems. Additionally, boundary data for patient-specific problems is often missing, incomplete, or unreliable. This makes the determination of a useful model challenging, as it requires the generation of reliable boundary data without introducing heavy computational costs. This seminar will address these challenges, as well as some others, and introduce new techniques for workarounds. Results from patient-specific cases will be presented and discussed.

They have since become important tools in image processing and over the last years semi-supervised learning strategies could be implemented with these PDEs at the core. The main ingredient is the graph Laplacian that stems from a graph representation of the data. This matrix is large and typically dense. We illustrate some of its crucial features and show how to efficiently work with the graph Laplacian. In particular, we need some of its eigenvectors and for this the Lanczos process needs to be implemented efficiently. Here, we suggest the use of the NFFT method for evaluating the matrix vector products without even fully constructing the matrix. We illustrate the performance on several examples. Recording of the talk (available to GSSI only) Zoom link Add event to Google calendar December 2, 2020 Patricia Diaz De Alba GSSI Numerical treatment for inverse electromagnetic problems Electromagnetic induction surveys are among the most popular techniques for non-destructive investigation of soil properties, in order to detect the presence of both ground inhomogeneities and particular substances. Frequency-domain electromagnetic instruments allow the collection of data in different configurations, that is, varying the intercoil spacing, the frequency, and the height above the ground. Based on a non-linear forward model used to describe the interaction between an electromagnetic field and the soil, the aim is to reconstruct the distribution of either the electrical conductivity or the magnetic permeability with respect to depth. To this end, the inversion of both the real (in-phase) and the imaginary (quadrature) components of the signal are studied by a regularized damped Gauss-Newton method. The regularization part of the algorithm is based on a low-rank approximation of the Jacobian of the non-linear model. Furthermore, in many situations, a regularization scheme retrieving smooth solutions is blindly applied, without taking into account the prior available knowledge. An algorithm for a regularization method that promotes the sparsity of the reconstructed electrical conductivity or magnetic permeability distribution is available. This regularization strategy incorporates a minimum gradient support stabilizer into a truncated generalized singular value decomposition scheme. The whole inversion algorithm has been enclosed in a MATLAB package, called FDEMtools, allowing the user to experiment with synthetic and experimental data sets, and different regularization strategies, in order to compare them and draw conclusions. The numerical effectiveness of the inversion procedure is demonstrated on synthetic and real datasets by using FDEMtools package. Zoom link Add event to Google calendar November 20, 2020 Christian Lubich University of Tuebingen Dynamical low-rank approximation This talk reviews differential equations and their numerical solution on manifolds of low-rank matrices or of tensors with a rank structure such as tensor trains or general tree tensor networks. These low-rank differential equations serve to approximate, in a data-compressed format, large time-dependent matrices and tensors or multivariate functions that are either given explicitly via their increments or are unknown solutions to high-dimensional evolutionary differential equations, with multi-particle time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equations and kinetic equations such as Vlasov equations as noteworthy examples of applications. Recently developed numerical time integrators are based on splitting the projection onto the tangent space of the low-rank manifold at the current approximation. In contrast to all standard integrators, these projector-splitting methods are robust to the unavoidable presence of small singular values in the low-rank approximation. This robustness relies on exploiting geometric properties of the manifold of low-rank matrices or tensors: in each substep of the projector-splitting algorithm, the approximation moves along a flat subspace of the low-rank manifold. In this way, high curvature due to small singular values does no harm. This talk is based on work done intermittently over the last decade with Othmar Koch, Bart Vandereycken, Ivan Oseledets, Emil Kieri, Hanna Walach and Gianluca Ceruti. Zoom link Add event to Google calendar November 18, 2020 Raffaele D'Ambrosio University of L'Aquila Structure-preserving numerics for stochastic differential equations Modern Numerical Analysis is not only devoted to accurately approximating the solutions of various problems through efficient and robust schemes, but also to retaining qualitative properties of the continuous problem over long times. Sometimes such conservation properties naturally characterize the numerical schemes, while in more complex situations preservation issues have to be conveyed into the numerical approximations. The talk is focused on presenting recent advances in structure-preservation issues for selected stochastic differential equations satisfying some characteristic invariance laws. The behaviour of stochastic multistep methods in the preservation of mean-square contractivity will be analyzed; we show, in this case, that conservation properties are hidden, as a matter of fact, into conditional stability properties of numerical schemes. The analysis will also be conveyed to the discretization of stochastic Hamiltonian problems for the numerical preservation of the behaviour of the expected Hamiltonian. The theoretical analysis will also be supported by the numerical evidence.

In this talk, I will address the problem of controlling linear dynamical networks from a control-energy or \"practical\" perspective. I will first focus on the model-based scenario and review the fundamental metrics, theoretical limitations, and challenges in controlling networks using a limited number of control nodes. In particular, I will emphasize the impact of the \"degree\" of non-normality of the network's adjacency matrix on the control performance. Then, I will switch to a data-driven scenario, and show how some network control problems can be efficiently solved by relying on experimental data only.

Benner) We describe an algorithm to compute the explicit inverse of a dense quasi-definite matrix, i.e., a symmetric matrix of the form [-BB^T, A; A^T, C^TC], with the (1,1) block negative semidefinite and the (2,2) block positive semidefinite. The algorithm is a variant of Gauss-Jordan elimination that works on the low-rank factors $B$ and $C$ directly without ever forming those blocks. The individual elimination steps amount to a transformation called principal pivot transform ; it was shown in [Poloni, Strabic 2016] how to perform it by working only on $A, B, C$, and we rely on that procedure here. We discuss the stability of the resulting method, and show how the algorithm (and in particular the produced low-rank factors) can be of use in control theory, in the context of the matrix sign iteration, which is a method used to solve algebraic Riccati equations.

Speaker Title, Abstract & Other Info Date Lars Ruthotto Emory University, USA Numerical Methods for Deep Learning motivated by Partial Differential Equations Understanding the world through data and computation has always formed the core of scientific discovery. Amid many different approaches, two common paradigms have emerged. On the one hand, primarily data-driven approaches\u2014such as deep neural networks\u2014have proven extremely successful in recent years. Their success is based mainly on their ability to approximate complicated functions with generic models when trained using vast amounts of data and enormous computational resources. But despite many recent triumphs, deep neural networks are difficult to analyze and thus remain mysterious. Most importantly, they lack the robustness, explainability, interpretability, efficiency, and fairness needed for high-stakes decision-making. On the other hand, increasingly realistic model-based approaches\u2014typically derived from first principles and formulated as partial differential equations (PDEs)\u2014are now available for various tasks. One can often calibrate these models\u2014which enable detailed theoretical studies, analysis, and interpretation\u2014with relatively few measurements, thus facilitating their accurate predictions of phenomena. In this talk, I will highlight recent advances and ongoing work to understand and improve deep learning by using techniques from partial differential equations. I will demonstrate how PDE techniques can yield better insight into deep learning algorithms, more robust networks, and more efficient numerical algorithms. I will also expose some of the remaining computational and numerical challenges in this area. Slides of the talk Recording of the talk (available to GSSI only) June 17, 2021 Ivan Markovsky Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium Data-driven dynamic interpolation and approximation The behavioral system theory give theoretical foundation for nonparameteric representations of linear time-invariant systems based on Hankel matrices constructed from data. These data-driven representations led in turn to new system identification, signal processing, and control methods. In particular, data-driven simulation and linear quadratic tracking control problems were solved using the new approach [1,2]. This talk shows how the approach can be used further on for solving data-driven interpolation and approximation problems (missing data estimation) and how it can be generalized to some classes of nonlinear systems. The theory leads to algorithms that are both general (can deal simultaneously with missing, exact, and noisy data of multivariable systems) and simple (require existing numerical linear algebra methods only). This opens a practical computational way of doing system theory and signal processing directly from data without identification of a transfer function or a state space representation and doing model-based design.

Tyrtyshnikov Institute for Numerical Mathematics, Russian Academy of Sciences Tikhonov's solution to a class of linear systems equivalent within perturbations A standard approach to incorrect problems suggests that a problem of interest is reformulated with the knowledge of some additional a-priori information. This can be done by several well-known regularization techniques. Many practical problems are successfully solved on this way. What does not still look as completely satisfactory is that the new reset problem seems to appear rather implicitly in the very process of its solution. In 1980, A. N. Tikhonov proposed a reformulation [1] that arises explicitly before the discussion of the solution methods. He suggested a notion of normal solution to a family of linear algebraic systems described by a given individual system and its vicinity comprising perturbed systems, under the assumption that there are compatible systems in the class notwithstanding the compatibility property of the given individual system. Tikhovov proved that the normal solution exists and is unique. However, a natural question about the correctness of the reset problem was not answered. In this talk we address a question of correctness of the reformulated incorrect problems that seems to have been missed in all previous considerations. The main result is the proof of correctness for Tikhonov's normal solution. Possible generalizations and difficulties will be also discussed. [1] A. N.

Based on these observations we want to infer the (dynamical) interactions between the entities we observe. In the context of a distributed system, this typically corresponds to a \"network identification\" task: find the (weighted) edges of the graph of interconnections. However, often the number of samples we can obtain from such a process are far too few to identify the edges of the network exactly. Can we still reliably infer some aspects of the underlying system? Motivated by this question we consider the following identification problem: instead of trying to infer the exact network, we aim to recover a (low-dimensional) statistical model of the network based on the observed signals on the nodes. More concretely, here we focus on observations that consist of snapshots of a diffusive process that evolves over the unknown network. We model the (unobserved) network as generated from an independent draw from a latent stochastic blockmodel (SBM), and our goal is to infer both the partition of the nodes into blocks, as well as the parameters of this SBM. We present simple spectral algorithms that provably solve the partition and parameter inference problems with high-accuracy. We further discuss some possible variations and extensions of this problem setup.

Zoom link Add event to Google calendar February 4, 2021 Anders Hansen University of Cambridge, UK On the foundations of computational mathematics, Smale's 18th problem and the potential limits of AI There is a profound optimism on the impact of deep learning (DL) and AI in the sciences with Geoffrey Hinton concluding that 'They should stop training radiologists now'. However, DL has an Achilles heel: it is universaly unstable so that small changes in the initial data can lead to large errors in the final result. This has been documented in a wide variety of applications. Paradoxically, the existence of stable neural networks for these applications is guaranteed by the celebrated Universal Approximation Theorem, however, the stable neural networks are never computed by the current training approaches. We will address this problem and the potential limitations of AI from a foundations point of view. Indeed, the current situation in AI is comparable to the situation in mathematics in the early 20th century, when David Hilbert\u2019s optimism (typically reflected in his 10th problem) suggested no limitations to what mathematics could prove and no restrictions on what computers could compute. Hilbert\u2019s optimism was turned upside down by Goedel and Turing, who established limitations on what mathematics can prove and which problems computers can solve (however, without limiting the impact of mathematics and computer science). We predict a similar outcome for modern AI and DL, where the limitations of AI (the main topic of Smale\u2019s 18th problem) will be established through the foundations of computational mathematics. We sketch the beginning of such a program by demonstrating how there exist neural networks approximating classical mappings in scientific computing, however, no algorithm (even randomised) can compute such a network to even 1-digit accuracy (with probability better than 1/2). We will also show how instability is inherit in the methodology of DL demonstrating that there is no easy remedy, given the current methodology. Finally, we will demonstrate basic examples in inverse problems where there exists (untrained) neural networks that can easily compute a solution to the problem, however, the current DL techniques will need 10^80 data points in the training set to get even 1% success rate.
