<p>Nicola Gugliemi is full professor in Numerical Analysis and Chair of the Doctoral School in Mathematics at GSSI. He is interested in the general area of scientific computing, particularly numerical analysis of ordinary and delay differential equations, stability analysis of (discretized) dynamical systems - including variable coefficient and switched systems - and ode methods in matrix perturbation theory and control, for high-dimensional problems.<br />
More specifically: Stiff and singularly perturbed problems (in particular in the framework of delay differential equations); software development for general classes of implicit delay differential equations; stability analysis of numerical integrators for ordinary and delay differential equations; computation of the joint spectral characteristics of a set of matrices, with application to contractivity analysis of time dependent systems of differential and difference equations; ode-based pseudospectral computations for both unstructured and structured problems; non-smooth analysis of discontinuous differential equations with focus on the computation of weak solutions. <br />

<p>Francesco Tudisco is assistant professor in the School of Mathematics at GSSI. His research interests lie at the intersection between matrix theory, scientific computing, network analysis and machine learning. In particular, some of the fields he is currently working on are: higher-order data mining, spectral methods for unsupervised and semi-supervised learning, community and core-periphery detection in networks, spectral theory for discrete graphs, nonlinear Perron-Frobenius theory, tensor methods and tensor eigenvectors, multilayer graph clustering and centrality.<br />
Before moving to the GSSI, Francesco  was a Marie Curie Individual Fellow at the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow (UK), working on the project: <em><a href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/209527/reporting/en">MAGNET: Models and algorithms for graph centrality based on nonlinear eigenvalue techniques</a>.</em> Prior to that, he held research assistant positions at Saarland University (Germany) and University of Padua (Italy). He obtained his PhD in Mathematics in 2015 from the University of Rome Tor Vergata (Italy).<br>

<p>I'm a recent PhD graduate in Mathematical Analysis, Modelling and Applications at the International School of Advanced Studies (SISSA) in Trieste.  My current position is as a postdoctoral researcher at the Gran Sasso Science Institute (GSSI) in L'Aquila.  My research interests are in operator theory and abstract approximation theory, taking inspiration from topics in theoretical numerical analysis with a particular emphasis on underlying functional analytic aspects.  My thesis topic focused on Krylov subspace methods and projection methods and was supervised by Prof. Alessandro Michelangeli (SISSA) and Prof. Paolo Novati (University of Trieste).</p>

<p>Patricia Diaz de Alba has obtained her PhD in Numerical Analysis at the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science of the University of Cagliari (Italy) in 2017. She has been a Postdoctoral Researcher at the same University from 2017 until 2020. Currently, she has a postdoctoral research position at the Gran Sasso Scientific Institute (GSSI) in L'Aquila (Italy). Her main research interest is in inverse problems and is focused on, but not limited to, image restoration in applied Geophysics. This research involves the application of techniques concerned with numerical linear algebra, optimization, and the solution of these inverse problems. Over the past few years, she has worked on several problems including regularization methods, ill-posed problems, and numerical and computational methods for integral and partial differential equations.<br />

<p>My research lies at the intersection of numerical analysis and engineering, where I focus on the use of numerical simulations to answer questions arising from engineering applications. My work encompasses many aspects of these problems, including the development of new physical models and of new algorithms to enable their accurate and efficient numerical solution.<br />
In terms of applications, I have a specific interest in cardiological problems, where I have collaborated extensively with medical doctors and engineers to provide solutions to problems of clinical interest. I am also interested in the mathematical modeling of epidemics in space and time; the ultimate goal of this research is to aid public health decision-makers. My approach to this problem draws heavily on my experience in continuum mechanics, and I believe these principles can be applied further to solve problems arising from the life sciences.<br />
From the mathematical point of view, this work is heavily concentrated in the area of numerical partial differential equations and finite element methods. As much of this work naturally leads to numerical linear algebra, I am also interested in the development of preconditioning and inexact algebraic factorization methods for the numerical solution of partial differential equations.</p>

<p>My name is Prokopchik Konstantin. I am from Russia. I received my bachelor’s degree in 2016 in Math’s, the work topic was about modelling the fracture in oil industry. Then I found out about the new master program in my university, that was launching in 2016. It’s called Big Data Analytics, but essentially, it’s just Computer Science. In master’s thesis I gathered a specific dataset of melodies, tried to observe and test a lot of systems that generate music and attempted to create a new one. Apart from studying, I’ve been working as a python programmer for the last year. I’ve played with different NLP tools, worked with plenty of AWS’s, Jenkins and I’m sure I will continue to explore a lot of things around this field.</p>
